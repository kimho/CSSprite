CSSprite
========

Wanted to tinker with a front end mini app, this one just allows you to drag/drop/interact with images to produce CSS background position coords.


TODO
========

- Add functionality of "control" panel that allows container resizing
- Output CSS string on drag end
- Uh...figure out what else I need to do. Hah.
