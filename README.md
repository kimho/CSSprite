CSSprite
========

Wanted to tinker with a front end mini app, this one just allows you to drag/drop/interact with images to produce CSS background position coords.


TODO
========

- Fix async / image load cache bug prevent images to display on first drag / drop
- figure out a better way to create Issues and types, possibly from a file, or from CLI?
- Flash widget to copy CSS to clipboard
- CSS / Stylus / Sass / LESS output?
- Add Control Panel "reset / snap" function to allow popping image back to 0,0 and div to image size
- Uh...figure out what else I need to do. Hah.
